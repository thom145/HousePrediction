This respository contains my code for the Kaggle Competition House Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

## CleanData.py
This python file contains the code necessary to clean the data provided to us by Kaggle.

## Algorithm.py
Makes use of the *CleanData.py* to clean the data. Thereafter, a model is trained on the train data. This model will later be used to make a prediction on the test data which will be used to submit.
